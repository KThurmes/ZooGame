** Description: getNumberBetween()  is a 
function that will ask the user to select a number between "low" and 
"high" (inclusive).  It calls getValidInt() to accept an integer from 
the user and then it tests that input to make sure the integer is 
within the acceptable range. If it is not, it will ask the user again
to submit a valid input until the user does.
** Return value: Returns the submitted integer that is within the 
accepted range
